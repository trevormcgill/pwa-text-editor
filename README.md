# PWA Text Editor (J.A.T.E)


## Description
For this challenge, my task was to build a browser-based text editor that functions as a single-page application and meets the criteria for a Progressive Web App (PWA). The primary goal was to create a reliable and user-friendly tool for users to create and store notes or code snippets, even when offline. To achieve this, I implemented several data persistence techniques, including utilizing IndexedDB for storing and retrieving data. The application's backend was set up using Express.js to serve the client and handle API requests. For bundling the client-side JavaScript, I used Webpack, which allowed me to generate an HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file. To ensure the application's offline functionality, I integrated workbox to manage the service worker and precache static assets. With these technologies in place, the text editor became a robust and efficient tool for users to seamlessly manage their notes and code snippets regardless of internet connectivity.
